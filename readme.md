This is a music player based on pygame-ce. You can't run it with pygame because the `box_blur()` blur function is not available in pygame. To use it, enter `pip install pygame-ce` in the command line and start using the pygame community edition!

**Known issue: The program can only run at 1600x900 resolution, otherwise there will be scaling issues.** (To be addressed in the future)

# Features

- **Drag and drop files** to start playing music (obviously)
- Random background image on startup (this isn't a wallpaper viewer!)
- Display cover art and artist information
- That's it, just these

# Plans

 - [X] Musical note effects while playing
 - [ ] Improved UI interface
 - [ ] Lyrics display
 - [ ] Gaussian blur for lyrics
 - [ ] Window resizing capability [not a high priority for now]
 - [ ] Automatic retrieval of lyrics, cover art, and other information [also not a high priority for now]
